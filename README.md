Learning a new skill

Hello all,

After 17 years in various test organizations within Microsoft's Main Redmond, Wa Campus, I have relocated back to Austin, Tx (where I lived for several years before moving to the Seattle, Wa area).

I have struggled a little to find the right job for my mostly Microsoft-focused skills, so I'm looking for ways to expand my skillsets in hopes of getting back into a regular, full-time position.
